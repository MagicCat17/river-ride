# river-ride
Keep alive application for the now defuct game Toontown Online.
The code would interact with the main game window and move the character around to prevent disconnection. It also had a function to watch for when the game area 'Nutty River' was available. This district was often unavailable as it was very popular. The code watched for the status being 'green' - and if so, simulated clicking the mouse.

Although Toontown Online no longer exists this is an interesting example of a simple program that watches the output of another window and also controlling mouse and keyboard (all using java.awt.Robot)
